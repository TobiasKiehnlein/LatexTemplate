# LatexTemplate

## What this is

This repository is meant to be a template for any Latex project. I personally use it for my papers in university but it can be used for pretty much any latex document.

This projects pipeline will automatically build and deploy your pdf document ([main.tex](main.tex) -> main.pdf) in github pages on every change on the master branch. [yourusername.github.io/yourrepositoryname]. To adjust this behaviour just edit the [github action](.github/workflows/buildTex.yml)

To use this repository just [create a new repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
