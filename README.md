# LatexTemplate

## What this is
This repository is meant to be a template for any Latex project. I personally use it for my papers in university but it can be used for pretty much any latex document.

To use this repository just [create a new repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
